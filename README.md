# Install Shadcn/ui  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This branch (`1-install/shadcn-ui`) is focused on installing and setting up **Shadcn/ui** in the project.  

## ðŸ”§ Installation Steps  
Follow these steps to install Shadcn/ui and verify its setup:  

1. **Initialize Shadcn/ui**  
   ```sh
   npx shadcn-ui@latest init
   ```  
   This command sets up Shadcn/ui in the project.  

2. **Add the Button Component**  
   ```sh
   npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
   ```  
   We installed the `button` component to test if Shadcn/ui is working properly.  

3. **Verify the Installation**  
   To confirm that Shadcn/ui was installed successfully, we rendered a button component in the project.
